# Side Bet Scrambler

## App Functionality:

This web app uses Mongo || Express || Express React Views is a golf digital scorecard tracker with the ability to save and view previous rounds.  It also pulls the golf course info in from a collection that I have created on mongodb.  Each user has their own profile page that is rendered based on the user's data.  This will be a project that I continue to work on that will incorporate the side bets/wagers which generally come with a competitive golf round.

## Page Design:

- Utilizes Bootstrap and a number of it's features.  The scorecard is collapsible and also allows for scrolling in the x-direction.  The web app also utilizes two different layouts, one is for the login/signup pages and the other will show once logged in.
